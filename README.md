# NOXTURN: Power Plant NOx Emission Prediction

### Background

* With rising electricity demand, emissions are also increasing, highlighting the need for effective reduction strategies.
* Nitrogen oxides (NOx) is a major contributor to fine dust, crop damage, and acid rain, negatively impacting public health and industrial activities.
* The emission sources in the energy sector are clearly identifiable and can be directly regulated through policy.
* Targeted power plant is planning to be equipped with a digital operating system, and has consistently been listed among the top NOx-emitting facilities.

### Project Objective

* Predict NOx emissions without internal sensored-data using only public external data
* Provide a low-cost, practical model for plants
